# Telemetry System for FSTUC
Scripts to extract sensor data for telemetry using an arduino and a rasberry pi.
The arduino gets as input the measurements from the sensors, formats them and passes them to the rasbeery pi.
Î¤he rasberry pi logs the data in an sd card and sends the data to a remote location using RF.

### <ins>TODO:</ins>
+ Fix arduino code for correct usage of RTC
+ Transform arduino output for usage of CAN bus
+ Implement sending data to remote pc
+ Create GUI for live data
