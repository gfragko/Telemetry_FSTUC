Scripts to extract sensor data for telemetry using an arduino and a rasberry pi.
The arduino gets as input the measurements from the sensors, formats thems and passes them to the rasbeery pi.
Finally the rasberry pi logs the data in an sd card.

TODO:
+Make modifications so that the code applies for all types of sensors
+Check precision of measurements
+Find a way to send data from rasberry pi directly to a pc when logging
